## Demos

This repository contains a number of MicroPython demos. Each is standalone and contains its own detailed README file. If you're new to MicroPython and want to follow more of a learning path through the code, we'd suggest looking at the demos in this order:

1. [Hello World](./hello-world/) - a simple blinking LED.
1. [Counting with Arcade Buttons](./button-counter/) - sending button count metrics to a Prometheus remote write endpoint.
1. [Scraping Metrics with Prometheus](./prometheus-scrape/) - exposing metrics via HTTP so that Prometheus can scrape them.
1. [Environment Monitoring with the Pimoroni Enviro+](./pimoroni-enviro-plus/) - monitoring the environment in a room with a variety of sensors connected to the Pimoroni Enviro+ add-on pack.
